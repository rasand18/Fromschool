print(f'''My name is Rasmus Andreasson but my friends usually call me by my intials, {initials}.
      I live in the city Gothenburg, which has the population of {population_g} people.
      It does sound like alot of people but when you compare it to the entire earth's population, which is {population_e} billion people, it's not that many.
      Today it's {weekday} and I am doing this homework for a course that I just started. The course will last all summer, about {course_length} and I am really
      looking forward to learn a lot about data and programming. Hopefully we'll learn a bit about math and how we can use it too optimize our cod. When I was little I used to love
      math and for some reason I learned the first sixteen digigts of pi, which is {number_pi}.''')
