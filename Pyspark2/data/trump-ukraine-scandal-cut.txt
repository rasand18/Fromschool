The Trump–Ukraine scandal was a political scandal in the United States involving
efforts by U.S. president Donald Trump to coerce Ukraine and other foreign
countries into providing damaging narratives about 2020 Democratic Party
presidential candidate Joe Biden as well as misinformation relating to Russian
interference in the 2016 United States elections. Trump enlisted surrogates
within and outside his official administration, including his personal lawyer
Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr, to pressure Ukraine and other
foreign governments to cooperate in supporting conspiracy theories concerning
American politics. Trump blocked payment of a congressionally mandated $400
million military aid package to allegedly obtain quid pro quo cooperation from
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump released the aid after becoming
aware of a whistleblower complaint about his activities relating to Ukraine,
before the complaint was known by Congress or the public. A number of contacts
were established between the White House and the government of Ukraine,
culminating in a phone call between Trump and Zelensky on July 25, 2019.
